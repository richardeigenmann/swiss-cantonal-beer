      This website doesn't really use cookies except to track that you clicked
      on this annoying banner. It does look like the beer images are dragging
      in some cookies and perhaps the gh-pages is using cookies to track visitors.
      At any rate, to comply with European and other laws you understand that
      this site may use cookies and that someone may be analysing the data
